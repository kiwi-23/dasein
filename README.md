<h1>Dasein</h1>

<p><b>
Dasein is an interactive algorithm structured system that symbolizes our unique individual life experience of being within a structural framework and allows us to experience the totality of everyone’s fundamental existence in relation to ours.

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
Dasein is a German word for “being” or “existing”, popularly used by the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger, in his philosophical enquiry associated with authentic human existence and what it meant <i>to be</i>. Heidegger explored many fundamental core principles behind the question of how is it that anything existed, and what is the reality in which we find ourselves, what is it to be, and what negates being.
<br><br>
John Koenig writes <i>“if someone were to ask you on your deathbed what it was like to live here on Earth, perhaps the only honest answer would be, ‘I don't know. I passed through it once, but I've never really been there.’”</i> as he tries to describe the frustration of being stuck in just one body that inhabits only one place at a time, aware that you’ll never truly get to experience everything the world has to offer, that despite everything all the things you haven't done and may never get around to doing; all the destinations you didn't buy a ticket to; all the lights you see in the distance that you can only wonder about; all the alternate histories you narrowly avoided; all the fantasies that stay dormant inside your head; everything you're giving up, to be where you are right now, you’re closing billion doors in order to take a step forward.
<br><br>
With these notions in mind, Dasein is constructed- to provide an experience of multiple life experiences alongside yours, to visually depict the smallness of your perspective in the full coalescence of being, yet emphasize your individual existence as unique and relevant enough to have an impact on the final outcome.

<h1>Structure</h1>

<p>
The system operates inside a predefined grid, divided into segmented units arranged in sets of rows and columns, each unit functioning as a single independent cell inside the structure.
